# HCIVREyeTracker
An upload of a school project.
The goal of the project was to create a novel interaction interface different from traditional keyboard and mouse.
My team decided to do eye tracking in VR, inspired by the at that point recently newly announced Vision Pro from Apple.
This project presents a rudimentary implimentation of an eye tracking solution for the Meta Quest Pro.
To run, import this project into Unity and push build to headset.
